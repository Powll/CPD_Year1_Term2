# CPD_Year1_Term2
Base repo for all CPD-related materials for the 2nd term of the 2018-2019 year

## Week 1

The first actual week of term time, in spite of being tired from the Game Jam I am able to focus on the game project, which I have been quite nervous about. I have not used Unreal as much as I would have liked to, mainly because I have been trying to find some tutorials that can at least set me in the right direction with what I need to do - spline related. Our PO meeting went about as well as I expected, we don't have anything to show just yet and to be quite frank I fear we will have a hard time maintaining an Agile work ethic. I will have to research deeper into the usage of Unreal splines with c++, as the lack of online tutorials is going to prove quite problematic.
